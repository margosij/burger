# burger

Here's the link to the [Heroku] (https://burger-eater-jm.herokuapp.com/) page!

I tried to have a folder for each section of the app, so there are quite a few different folders for this one.

Some of the technologies used were:
    1. handlebars
    2. Node
    3. Javascript
    4. Gitignore
    5. MySQL
    6. Express

My role in this project was the writer, designer and tester of the code.

In order to use this app, all you'll need to do is open the app and add in what type of burger you'd like to eat. Once added, you can click the "Devour it!" button and the burger will move from the "Burgers that still need to be eaten!" section to the "Burger devoured!" section.
